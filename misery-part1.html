          <p>We once believed suffering made us human, that grief, like joy, was a private inheritance shaping the boundaries of who we could become. But in the near future, pain is no longer silent. It can be measured, bought, sold, and traded like any other commodity.</p>
          <p><strong>The Misery Market</strong> has given humanity the power to turn misery into data, emotions into currency—and promises relief… at a price.</p>
          <p>For <strong>Dr. Elias Morran</strong>, its creator, the Market rose from the ashes of personal tragedy, a system designed to stabilise a world on the brink of emotional collapse. But for <strong>Nia Vollen</strong>, commanding officer of the Sector 9 precinct and haunted by her own loss, it is a dangerous illusion—a tool of control built on the backs of the broken.</p>
          <p>As Elias defends his vision and Vollen hunts for the truth, their opposing ideals ignite a collision that will tear open the Market's polished surface. Beneath lies a conspiracy that could shatter what remains of society's emotional balance.</p>
          <p>Here, every smile has a cost. Every tear has value. And the price of truth might be more than anyone can pay.</p>
          <p class="genre-tag">Sci-fi psychological thriller about power, grief, control, and the commodification of human experience.</p>
