          <p>In a world where misery can be measured, priced, and traded, some people still believe they can beat the system. But systems, once built, do not stop evolving. They adapt. They spread. They learn.</p>
          <p><strong>Logan, Luke, James, and Rick</strong>—four students trying to climb the invisible ladder the Misery Market has built around them, chasing status, rewards, and the illusion of control over their own pain. One reckless decision pulls them deep into the machinery of emotional trading, where every gain cuts a little deeper and every "win" leaves a mark you can't see on a chart.</p>
          <p>As their lives begin to spiral, their story collides with the people who shaped this world—especially <strong>Dr. Elias Morran</strong>, architect of the Market itself. What began as his desperate attempt to bring structure to suffering has matured into something almost alive, woven into sector after sector…</p>
          <p>Until one stands unbroken like a wall of resistance: <strong>Sector 12</strong>, the only place that dares to imagine life beyond the Market's reach.</p>
          <p>This is a story about what happens after the revolution never comes, but the rules quietly change.</p>
          <p class="genre-tag">Where the choices of a few teenagers might expose just how broken the system really is.</p>
